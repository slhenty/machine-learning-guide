# MLPatterns

A pattern guide to Machine Learning (ML) models

## Use

This is for my own personal use, so no warranty or suitability to purpose is offered or guranteed, should this content
find its way into public view.

The content is essentially my attempt to take proper notes across several online ML courses, and during discovery of
other ML resources.

## Structure

The primary organizational principle is a _pattern guide_, in the vein of the Gang of Four and other software
engineering pattern guides.

## Format

For fairly obvious reasons, I'm using a Jupyter notebook to record the patterns and provide functioning examples of ML
code.

## Guide

The entry point to the pattern guide is a Jupyter Notebook, [Guide](mlpatterns/Guide.ipynb), in the root of the project.
